============

Zipfelchappe is a crowdfunding tool based on django and feincms.

An old campaign realised with zipfelchappe can be found here:

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Zipfelchappe was implemented for paypal adaptive payments.
However, paypal dropped adaptive payments and is currently working on a new
API for crowdfunding payments.
