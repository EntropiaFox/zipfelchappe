About zipfelchappe
==================

Zipfelchappe is an open source crowdfunding platform. Inspired by various
crowdfunding pages like `kickstarter.com <http://kickstarter.com>`_,
`fundable.com <http://fundable.com>`_, `indiegogo.com <http://indiegogo.com>`_
and `wemakeit.ch <http://wemakeit.ch>`_, we try to offer the very same
functionality and a little bit more.

The main advantage of zipfelchappe: it's free, customizable, styleable and can
be integrated in your existing webpage. Free means not only that you are allowed
to install and use the software freely, you also decide where the money goes!
Zipfelchappe does not cut a share of your pledges or raise a monthly fee.

Flexible funding framework
--------------------------

Right now, zipfelchappe supports the commonly known "all or nothing" goal based
funding principle. This means:

 * You set a goal when you start your project
 * People may back your project in a limited period of time
 * After this period, money will only be collected if your goal was reached

To implement this behaviour, we use `Paypal's Preapproved Adaptive Payments`_.
However, you are free to use any other funding framework or payment system you
can think of. We will try to collect these methods and implementations so you
can choose which way works best for you.
