zipfelchappe crowdfunding
=========================

Zipfelchappe is a simple open source crowdfunding platform based on the django
framework. This project is inpired by various crowdfunding pages like:

* `kickstarter.com <http://kickstarter.com>`_
* `indiegogo.com <http://indiegogo.com>`_
* `wemakeit.ch <http://wemakeit.ch>`_

The main advantage of zipfelchappe: it's free, customizable, styleable and can
be integrated in your existing webpage. Free means not only that you are allowed
to install and use the software freely, you also decide where the money goes!
Zipfelchappe does not cut a share of your pledges or raise a monthly fee.
